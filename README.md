**Space Vision** is an interactive project designed to explore the Sun and its behavior through vector visualizations and informational panels, all powered by scientific data and educational resources. This platform is aimed at students interested in astronomy, space sciences, and the study of stars.

The project presents an interactive model where users can explore the composition of the Sun, its energy source, its influence on Earth, and its solar cycle. Through an intuitive and visually appealing interface, students can better understand how our star works and how it impacts life on Earth.

## Link to the Challenge

This project is part of a challenge hosted on the [Render](https://spacevision.onrender.com) platform, an environment for creating and deploying applications. The challenge seeks an interactive way to explore advanced astronomical concepts and provide an engaging learning resource.

## Project Objectives

The main objective of **Space Vision** is to offer an interactive experience where students can:

* **Explore the structure of the Sun**: Internal composition, layers of the Sun, and how nuclear reactions are generated.
* **Understand the energy source**: How nuclear fusion in the Sun's core creates the energy that reaches the surface.
* **Investigate the Sun's influence on Earth**: How solar radiation affects climate, seasons, and generates phenomena such as auroras and solar storms.
* **Study the solar cycle and the future of the Sun**: How the Sun goes through activity cycles and what its fate is over millions of years.

Through interactive visualizations, users will be able to see 3D models of the Sun and its structure, while also navigating through different sections of the project using intuitive controls.

## Target Audience

This project is primarily aimed at **students interested in astronomy, space sciences, and physics**. It is ideal for those who want to learn about the Sun in an interactive, comprehensible, and engaging way. Additionally, the project’s design makes it accessible to both high school and university students who are looking to explore scientific concepts in a practical manner.

## Project Features

1. **Interactive Solar Exploration**:

   * 3D models of the Sun with visual details about its internal structure.
   * Informational panels displaying scientific data and facts about the Sun.

2. **Interactivity**:

   * Navigation between different sections of the project with scroll controls and navigation buttons.
   * Smooth animations and transitions between informational panels, creating a fluid experience.

3. **Responsive Design**:

   * The project is designed to be fully **responsive**, meaning it can be explored on both mobile and desktop devices.
   * It adapts to various screen sizes and devices, ensuring an optimal experience regardless of the medium.

4. **Informational Panels**:

   * Each section includes an informational panel with text, graphics, and an interactive illustration of the Sun and its properties.
   * The panels address topics such as the Sun's composition, nuclear fusion, solar storms, and much more.

## Technologies Used

The project uses the following technologies:

* **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript** for the web structure and design.
* **Babylon.js** for creating interactive 3D graphics (such as the Sun models).
* **SVGs** for interactive illustrations of nuclear fusion, the solar cycle, and interactions with Earth.
* **Responsive Design** using CSS techniques like `@media` and `clamp()` to ensure a suitable user experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
